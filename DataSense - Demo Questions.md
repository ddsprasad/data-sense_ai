Q5: "Break down our competitive losses by competitor - who are we losing to most often?"

Q7: "Show me members with auto loans who've had payment delays in the last 6 months, and correlate with recent credit bureau utilization increases"



Q8: "Which members have negative checking account balances more than 3 times in the last 90 days, and do they show increasing credit utilization trends in bureau data?"

"How many members had credit inquiries in the last 60 days across all product types?"



"Break that down by product type - how many were shopping for auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, and personal loans?"



"For auto loan inquiries, show me our capture rate - how many resulted in loans with us versus competitors?"



"Show me our top 5 competitors by loan capture from our members, with average loan amounts"



"For members we lost to \[Top Competitor], what's the average rate differential and do they have certain demographics?"



"Which members are still shopping - had inquiries but no new tradelines - in the last 21 days, with credit scores above 680?"



"Of members still shopping, which ones already have existing relationships with us, and what products do they have?"



"Show me members who inquired with us but went to competitors, and now show delinquency on those new loans in bureau data"



"Identify members with increasing credit utilization (up 20%+ in 90 days) who also have loans with us"
